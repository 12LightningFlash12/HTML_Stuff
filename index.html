            <p class = "par2 text">This site was made out of pure joy, using codehs.com, with HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. This site was built to showcase the capabilities of codehs.com's HTML 5/JavaScript module. This site will be built in the old website fshion, when anyone could make a website with Notepad or something. With that said, this site will have an old style look to it, with little fancy things (away from links, background color, and images). If you want to see how this site was coded, you can use the page source shortcut. On Safari, the shortcut is: Option + Command + u; on Chrome, the shortcut is: Contol(ctrl) + u.</p>
            
            <p class = "par2 text">Also, this website will not go into detail about everything a website can do. Instead, this website will show examples, and touch the surface about each subject. But, there will be links to websites, that will go into great detail about each subject. </p>
